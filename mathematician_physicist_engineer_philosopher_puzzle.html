<h1>One Of The Logic Puzzles Of All Time</h1>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">This page is based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUPr07ThSH0">video</a> about a logic puzzle.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">In this puzzle there are four people who have four jobs, speak using three code words, and have rules about what answers they can give to questions.</p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>People</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Codewords</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Foo, Bar, Baz</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Jobs</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Mathematician - Accurately answers Yes or No using two code words</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Physicist - Accurately answers Yes or No using the same two code words as the Mathematician but switched</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Engineer - Randomly answers using the same two codewords as the Mathematician</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Philosopher - Always answers Maybe with the remaining codeword</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">The goal of the puzzle is to identify what job each person has.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">There is a solution of this puzzle with at most 5 questions in the worst case.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">We will need to find out the identity of all 4 people. We will not need to know and will not find out which code word means Yes or No, but we will find out which code word means Maybe in all but one case. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Without loss of generality, because all the names and codewords start out interchangeable, we may as well assume that the first question is asked of the first person and the first response is Foo. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">We will start by listing out all of the possible combinations, or parallel worlds, which could be consistent with that first question.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Then we will list out all of the answers to the questions. In many cases, these answers are totally determined by the identity of the person the question is asked of. In the other cases, the answers can be freely demanded by phrasing the question appropriately.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">We will require a notion of trustworthiness, where the most trustworthy are the Mathematician and Physicist, the next most trustworthy is the Philosopher, and the least trustworthy is the Engineer. Choosing between the Mathematician and Physicist will never turn out to be necessary, because the Philosopher and Engineer do not make choices, and because the Mathematician and Physicist will not be asked to judge their own trustworthiness. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">As the first three questions progress, codewords that have already been used will be chosen to navigate back to the individual who used them, and codewords that have not been used will be chosen to navigate to a new individual for questioning. This phase of questioning is over when three questions are answered or immediately if it navigates back to Alice. At that point all further questions are addressed to the person selected by this phase, as they have been determined to be totally trustworthy. </p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Q1 to Alice: Which of the other three people is the most trustworthy?</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Foo: Bob</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Bar: Carol</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Baz: Dave</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Q2 to Bob: Which of the other three people is the most trustworthy?</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Foo: Alice</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Bar: Carol</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Baz: Dave</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Q3 to Carol if Q2 answer was Bar: Which of the other three people is the most trustworthy?</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Foo: Alice</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Bar: Bob</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Baz: Dave</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Q3 to Dave if Q2 answer was Baz: Which of the other three people is the most trustworthy?</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Foo: Alice</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Baz: Bob</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>Bar: Carol</tt></p>
<!-- TODO: what if I merge the Q2Bar and Q2Baz cases in the table below? -->
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt></tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt></tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt></tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">But how can we be sure that this final person is trustworthy? We will consider all the possible cases, in terms of the order of jobs that are held by the people the questions are addressed to. The Mathematician and Physicist are the only two trustworthy roles, and will be used interchangeably in this listing. Crucially, in this listing the Mathematician and Physicist can always avoid directing to the Engineer.</p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Engineer->Foo->Philosopher->Bar->Mathematician->Baz->Physicist</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>The Philosopher cannot say Foo, so will have to direct to someone trustworthy, who will then direct to the other trustworthy person.</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Engineer->Foo->Mathematician->Bar->Philosopher->Baz->Physicist</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>The Philosopher cannot say Foo or Bar, so will have to direct to the remaining trustworthy person.</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Engineer->Foo->Mathematician->Bar->Physicist->Bar->Mathematician</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>The Physicist can direct back to the trustworthy Mathematician using the same codeword.</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Philosopher->Foo->Engineer->Bar->Mathematician->Baz->Physicist</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>The Engineer cannot say Foo, so will have to direct to someone trustworthy, who will then direct to the other trustworthy person.</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Philosopher->Foo->Mathematician->Bar->Physicist->Bar->Mathematician</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>The Physicist can direct back to the trustworthy Mathematician using the same codeword.</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Mathematician->Foo->Philosopher->Bar->Physicist->Foo->Mathematician</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>The Philosopher can only direct to the Physicist, because otherwise the Mathematician would have already.</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>Mathematician->Foo->Physicist->Foo->Mathematician</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;"><tt>The Physicist can direct back to the trustworthy Mathematician using the same codeword.</tt></p>
