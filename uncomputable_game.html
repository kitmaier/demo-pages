		error for timeout with user-configurable timeout limit
		error for code too long with user-configurable length limit
	second panel will have a spoiler program that runs the code of the user's program with its own length as input and then prints a number one higher than the user's program
		BigInt
		might be easier if the user's program is required to return a number instead of console output
	demonstrates that the sequence of numbers / integer valued function "largest number that can be printed by code of a given length from no input data" is uncomputable

<h1>The Name-A-Bigger-Number Game</h1>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">What is the biggest number you can name, of the sort that can be counted to? (whole positive numbers, not infinity)</p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>One hundred?</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>One thousand?</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>One billion?</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>One quintillion?</tt></p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;">If you were playing a game of name-the-biggest-number with an opponent, how would you beat them?</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">There are at least two simple cheat codes. The first is the words, "whatever you said plus one." No matter what your opponent has said, there will always be a next number in sequence, which is larger.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">The other simple cheat code is the words, "the largest number that could be printed out by a computer program of length up to 1000 characters".</p>
<!-- why not say 1 million characters instead -->
<p style="text-indent:40px;">This will absolutely sweep the board with almost anything your opponent might have said. Of course, the winning response to that is still, that plus one.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">The reason this is so powerful is that computer programming languages, and other similar logical and mathematical systems, are very good at describing complicated calculations compactly. These calculations can produce very large numbers with surprisingly little information to start from.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">For instance, consider the below program, which is less than 100 characters long. It would print out the number one googolplex if given unlimited resources for the calculation. In practice, it will run out of time and space, as the number has more digits than there are atoms in the universe and printing it out would take more time than the age of the universe. </p>
<!-- make this code more readable -->
<!-- make this interactive so the user can choose the parameters and run it to get the results printed out, use BigInt -->
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>let a=b=1;</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>for(let k=0; k&lt100; k++) b = b*10; // calculate 10^100</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>for(let k=0; k&ltb; k++) a = a*10; // calculate 10^(10^100)</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:80px;"><tt>print(a);</tt></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">So now the question has become, what is the biggest number that a computer program of a given size could print out? </p>
<h1>The Largest Printable Number</h1>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">LPN(N) will represent the largest number printable by a computer program of length N characters in an idealized computing environment, where limitations of time, computer memory, and electricity are not a concern. The details of the computing environment, such as particular programming language, should remain consistent but are not important. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">LPN(N+1) ≥ LPN(N) because you can always just add a space character somewhere in the program without changing what number it outputs.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">LPN(N+K) ≥ 10*LPN(N) for some constant K, because you can always multiply the output by 10 or add a zero to the end of it with some small amount of added code.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">LPN(85) ≥ 10^(10^100) as just shown.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">What if there was a computer program that could calculate LPN(N) automatically? That is, a program that could take in a number representing the length of a computer program, and then do some calculations and print out the largest number that a program of that length could print out? </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">As it turns out, this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Suppose that it were possible, and there were a specific program A that could solve this calculation. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Then we can create a second program B, which proves that A is sometimes wrong, contradicting this assumption. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Let B contain the same calculation as A, and let it run on the length of the program B to get an estimate of the largest number that B could print out. Then B will add one to that number and print it out, proving A wrong. </p>
<table id="configsTable" style="width:600px;margin-left:80px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Program A</th>
		<th>Program B</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			// what if LPN(N) = 10^N<br/>
			let b = 1;<br/>
			for(let k=0; k&ltN; k++) b = b*10;<br/>
			print(b);
		</td>
		<td>
			// then calculate 10^70+1<br/>
			let N = 70;<br/>
			let b = 1;<br/>
			for(let k=0; k&ltN; k++) b = b*10;<br/>
			b = b+1;<br/>
			print(b);
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Notice here that B is not allowed to take any input, and must contain within its own code any numbers or other calculations it wants to operate on. A, on the other hand, is taking input of the length of some other program. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">B is a program that is 70 characters long, so according to A, B should not print out any number bigger than 10^70. B does print out the number 10^70+1, proving that A is not the correct calculation for LPN(N).</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">No matter what calculation is performed in A, the same pattern will apply for a new B program to prove that A calculates too low of a number. The function LPN(N) can not be calculated by any program, and in fact it grows much more rapidly as N increases than any function that can be. </p>
<h1>The Longest Running Program</h1>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Let the largest number of steps taken in a calculation by a program of length N be called LNS(N). The details of what counts as a step should remain consistent but are not important.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">This function also cannot be calculated by any program. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Suppose that the program A could take in a number N representing the length of another program, perform some calculations, and then print out the largest number of steps of calculation that a program of that length can perform without falling into some kind of infinite loop. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Let the program B perform the same kind of calculation as program A but on its own length, then run for at least that many steps and then stop. Then the program B has proven the program A wrong about the value of LNS(N).</p>
<table id="configsTable" style="width:600px;margin-left:80px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Program A</th>
		<th>Program B</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			// what if LNS(N) = 10^N<br/>
			let b = 1;<br/>
			for(let k=0; k&ltN; k++) b = b*10;<br/>
			print(b);
		</td>
		<td>
			// then run for more than 10^92 steps<br/>
			let N = 92;<br/>
			let a = 0;<br/>
			let b = 1;<br/>
			for(let k=0; k&ltN; k++) b = b*10;<br/>
			for(let k=0; k&ltb+1; k++) a++;
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">It is also possible to relate LNS(N) and LPN(N) to one another.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">LPN(N) ≤ LNS(N+K) for some constant K as shown above, because given the code of the program of length N that prints out the largest number, a small amount of added code can run a loop for that many steps. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">LNS(N) ≤ LPN(N+K) for some constant K as shown above, because given the code of the program of length N that runs for the largest number of steps before stopping, a small amount of added code could increment a counter for each step of the program and then print out the result. This progam will be more complicated, because it needs to take in the code of the prior program as a text variable and use a general purpose code interpretation program to get the count of computational steps. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">This means that a slightly longer program can run for more steps than any number a shorter program can print out, and can print out a larger number than the number of steps that a shorter program can run. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Because each function could be used as an upper bound for the other, either one being uncomputable means that both are.</p>
<h1>The Halting Problem</h1>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Previously, the focus has been on programs that calculate something and then finish their calculation and stop. Many programs do not stop, but rather keep calculating forever, such as a program that just keeps incrementing the value of a variable forever. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">What if there was a program A that could take in a number N representing the length of a program, perform some calculations, and then print out how many programs of that length run forever?</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">As it turns out, this is also impossible. We will consider a rather compicated program U to prove this.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Let U be a program that iterates over every possible program of length N, and runs each program for K steps, for larger and larger values of K. Any program that fails to run or runs to completion is discarded. U keeps track of the largest number of steps any program has so far run for before finishing. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">When U gets to the number of incomplete programs that A has predicted, then it stops and prints out the length of the longest running program so far computed, which is a correct value for LNS(N).</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Since it is impossible that the value that U has computed is correct, it must be that the value computed by A is wrong as well. Either A guessed too high and so U guessed too low, or A guessed too low and U never finished running.</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">This can also be determined more directly. Suppose that there was a program H(P) that takes in the code of a program P and answers whether that program will eventually halt, or will run forever. Suppose also that we have constructed a program U(P) that will run a program P given its code, which is possible in any standard programming environment. Then we will construct a program B() that takes no input and proves that H(B) gives the wrong answer. </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">The example program below is in a summarized form, as the actual program would be fairly long and dependent on the details of the programming language. </p>
<table id="configsTable" style="width:600px;margin-left:80px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Program B</th>
		<th>Program C</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			// variables containing the text of other programs<br/>
			u = "U"; <br/>
			h = "H"; <br/>
			c = "C"; <br/>
			// pass the above information to U and run program C<br/>
			p = "u = "+u+"; h = "+h+"; c = "+c+"; "+c;<br/>
			U(p); 
		</td>
		<td>
			// steps to generate B<br/>
			// run H(B)<br/>
			// do the opposite
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<!-- TODO: is there a way to describe the halting problem without either analyzing the code of an input program or iterating over all programs of a given length? -->
